          <li>for level 2, the mark interval between the top and bottom grades is divided by three. Where there is a remainder of one, the extra mark is added to the grade A interval. Where there is a remainder of two, one extra mark is added to each of the grade A and grade B intervals</li>
          <li>for level 3, the mark interval between the top and bottom grades is divided by five. Where there is a remainder of one, the extra mark is added to the grade A interval. Where there is a remainder of two, one extra mark is added to each of the grade A and grade B intervals.

      <p class="govuk-body">We set out below the requirements which an awarding organisation must comply with when it specifies deadlines for requesting reviews of marking, reviews of Moderation and appeals. These requirements are published under Conditions Project8.3(b), Project11.3(b) and Project12.4(b) and apply to all project qualifications.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Awarding organisations are no longer required to set deadline dates for Learners/Centres to request reviews of marking, reviews of Moderation and appeals. In choosing to set any deadlines, an awarding organisation must comply with the requirements set out below and with all other requirements in its Conditions of Recognition.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">In particular the requirements set out below must be read and complied with in conjunction with the Project Qualification Level Conditions (which set out further requirements in relation to an awarding organisation's arrangements).</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">The requirements set out below align with the Project Qualification Level Conditions which are in effect. Some relevant Project Qualification Level Conditions have not yet come into effect and there are currently some transitional provisions in effect. We will keep the requirements set out below under review as any changes are made.</p>

Learners are required to select a suitable topic for their project. This means that:

at levels 1 and 2, the topic must be chosen by the Learner(s) through negotiation with their Teacher and, if appropriate, an employer, and
at level 3, the topic must be chosen by the Learner(s) and agreed by the Centre and, if appropriate, an employer.
At all levels, the project chosen by the Learner(s) must have the potential to provide the Learner(s) with opportunities to meet all the assessment objectives.

The awarding organisation must ensure that Centres confirm that Learners’ project topics support Learner progression.

Assessment must include evidence of:

the planning and process of the project
the sources and range of information and other resources accessed
the range of skills used, including, where appropriate, the use of new technologies
the knowledge, skills and understanding used to complete the tasks/activities of the project
an outcome demonstrating the Learner’s knowledge, skills and understanding,
at level 1, a review of the outcomes of the project, and an evaluation of own performance and learning, and
at level 2, an evaluation of the outcomes of the project and an evaluation of own performance and learning.
Level 3
Assessment must include evidence of:

at least one written piece
the design, strategic planning and process of the project
the sources and range of information and other resources accessed
analysis of the data and a clear indication of how findings were used to inform the project
the range of skills used, including, where appropriate, problem solving and the use of new technologies
an outcome demonstrating the Learner’s knowledge, skills and understanding
an evaluation of own performance, learning and decision making, and
a presentation for a non-specialist audience, communicating outcomes, conclusions and evaluation.

Requirements for setting specified levels of attainment for project qualifications
Condition Project3.1 allows us to specify requirements and guidance in relation to the setting of specified levels of attainment for project qualifications.

We set out our requirements for the purposes of Condition Project3.1 below.

For ease of reference, the specified levels of attainment used in project qualifications are referred to below as ‘grades’.

Awarding of project qualifications
Awarding organisations must award, and report on, the project qualification using the following grading scales:

(a) For level 1 – A*, A and B for graded results and U for unclassified results
(b) For level 2 – A*, A, B and C for graded results and U for unclassified results
(c) For level 3 – A*, A, B, C, D and E for graded results and U for unclassified results.
In each case A* is the highest grade.

Setting key grade boundaries
Grade boundary marks for the project will be determined judgementally for the following key boundaries:

(a) Level 1:
(i) B/U
(ii) A*/A.
(b) Level 2:
(i) C/U
(ii) A*/A.
(c) Level 3:
(i) E/U
(ii) A*/A.
The other boundary marks are determined arithmetically:

(a) For level 1, the mark interval between the top and bottom grades is divided by two. Where there is a remainder of one, the extra mark is added to the grade A interval.
(b) For level 2, the mark interval between the top and bottom grades is divided by three. Where there is a remainder of one, the extra mark is added to the grade A interval. Where there is a remainder of two, one extra mark is added to each of the grade A and grade B intervals.
(c) For level 3, the mark interval between the top and bottom grades is divided by five. Where there is a remainder of one, the extra mark is added to the grade A interval. Where there is a remainder of two, one extra mark is added to each of the grade A and grade B intervals. Where there is a remainder of three, one extra mark is added to each of the grade A, B and C intervals. Where there is a remainder of four, one extra mark is added to each of the grade A, B, C and D intervals.

Reviews of marking, moderation, and appeals: requirements for key dates for project qualifications
We set out below the requirements which an awarding organisation must comply with when it specifies deadlines for requesting reviews of marking, reviews of Moderation and appeals. These requirements are published under Conditions Project8.3(b), Project11.3(b) and Project12.4(b) and apply to all project qualifications.

Awarding organisations are no longer required to set deadline dates for Learners/Centres to request reviews of marking, reviews of Moderation and appeals. In choosing to set any deadlines, an awarding organisation must comply with the requirements set out below and with all other requirements in its Conditions of Recognition.

In particular the requirements set out below must be read and complied with in conjunction with the Project Qualification Level Conditions (which set out further requirements in relation to an awarding organisation’s arrangements).

The requirements set out below align with the Project Qualification Level Conditions which are in effect. Some relevant Project Qualification Level Conditions have not yet come into effect and there are currently some transitional provisions in effect. We will keep the requirements set out below under review as any changes are made.

Requirements for key dates for assessments other than assessments which are marked by a Centre [footnote 1]
An awarding organisation must ensure that the requirements in the table below are met in each case where the assessment is not marked by a Centre. The table sets out the minimum timeframe within which the awarding organisation must allow a review/appeal to be requested. Provided a review/appeal is allowed to be requested in that timeframe, an awarding organisation is permitted to also provide an ‘accelerated service’ (for example, where requests for reviews provided by an earlier date will be processed more quickly).

STAGE	TIMEFRAME REQUIREMENTS
A	Date results are issued.	 
B	Date by which a request for Marked Assessment Material must be made (where applicable).	Learner or Centre making the request must be allowed at least two weeks following Stage A to make the request
C	Date of receipt of Marked Assessment Material.	 
D	Date by which a request for a review of marking of Marked Assessment Material must be made [footnote 2].	Learner or Centre making the request must be allowed at least four weeks following Stage A to make the request and where Marked Assessment Materials are required to be provided, Learner or Centre making the request must be allowed at least two weeks following Stage C to make the request.
E	Date awarding organisation reports the outcome of the review of marking [footnote 3] .	 
F	Date by which reasons for the outcome of the review must be requested [footnote 4].	 
G	Date awarding organisation provides reasons for the outcome of the review.	 
H	Date by which a request for Marked Assessment Material must be made (where not previously requested prior to the review of Marked Assessment Material)	Learner or Centre making the request must be allowed at least two weeks following Stage G to make the request
I	Date of receipt of Marked Assessment Material.	 
J	Date by which an appeal of the result of the assessment must be requested [footnote 5].	Learner or Centre making the request must be allowed at least four weeks following Stage E to make the request, and where reasons for the outcome of the review have been requested (by Stage F, where specified by the awarding organisation), Learner or Centre making the request must be allowed at least two weeks following Stage G to request an appeal
K [footnote 6]	Awarding organisation reports outcome of the appeal	 
Requirements for key dates for assessments which are marked by a Centre [footnote 7]
An awarding organisation must ensure that the requirements in the table below are met in each case where the assessment is marked by a Centre. The table sets out the minimum timeframe within which the awarding organisation must allow a review/appeal to be requested. As above, provided a review/appeal is allowed to be requested in that timeframe, an awarding organisation is permitted to also provide an ‘accelerated service’.

STAGE	TIMEFRAME REQUIREMENTS
A	Date awarding organisation issues the outcome of its Moderation.	 
B	Date by which a request for a review of Moderation must be made [footnote 8].	Centre making the request must be allowed at least four weeks following Stage A to make the request.
C	Date awarding organisation reports the outcome of the review of Moderation [footnote 9].	 
D	Date awarding organisation provides reasons for the outcome of the review [footnote 10].	 
E	Date by which an appeal of the outcome of Moderation must be requested [footnote 11].	Centre making the request must be allowed at least four weeks following Stage C to make the request, and Centre making the request must be allowed at least two weeks following Stage D to make the request.
F	Awarding organisation reports outcome of the appeal [footnote 12].
